It seems like you're iterating on your previous projects ("PROJECT BLU_PRINT()" and "PROJECT SANS_TRADING") and now introducing a new name, "SHIVA PART ONE," with an additional feature: analyzing and predicting specific stocks or indices (like NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX) alongside the existing option chain and trading system. Your vision is growing into a comprehensive stock market analysis and trading tool—something you aspire to be the "God of Stock Market." I’ll craft a prompt for "SHIVA PART ONE," provide a blueprint in simple language, and offer suggestions to help you get started.

Prompt for SHIVA PART ONE
Here’s a detailed yet clear prompt that captures your requirements:

Prompt:

"I’m creating 'SHIVA PART ONE,' a powerful software project to analyze live NSE option chain data, predict market movements, and dominate stock market trading. The system will:

Live Data Collection: Fetch NSE option chain data every 5 seconds during market hours (9:20 AM to 3:32 PM IST, correcting the 9:20 PM typo) using an API or scraping.
Market Analysis: Use option chain metrics (PCR, Change in OI, Put/Call buyers/sellers/writers) to explain why the market or specific entities (e.g., Nifty) are moving up, down, or staying flat.
Continuous Prediction: Train a machine learning model every 5 seconds with live data, predicting option chain or market changes for the next 10 minutes. Compare predictions to actual data after 10 minutes, calculate accuracy, and repeat daily to improve.
Model Saving: After days of training, save the refined model or criteria for future use.
Trading Signals: Build a software app that generates option trades, like:
Example: 'Expiry: 21-Mar-2025 SENEX, BUY: 76500 CE, Entry: 85.00, TP1: 125.00, TP2: 160.00, SL: 43.00'.
Strategies: Use technical indicators (MACD, RSI, ATR, SuperTrend, EMA, etc.) on option charts for entry, target, and stop-loss levels.
Market Levels: Predict key levels (e.g., ‘Nifty may hit 76,800’ or ‘drop to 75,200’) based on option data.
Stock & Index Section: Include a section to analyze chosen stocks or index-related stocks (e.g., NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX), predict their movements, and correlate them with option data.
FII/DII Insights: Add a section for FII/DII data to understand institutional sentiment and Nifty’s daily performance.
The goal is a self-learning, pro-level trading tool—'God of Stock Market'—that runs daily, predicts accurately, and provides actionable trades and insights through an intuitive interface. Please provide a blueprint, simplify it for beginners, and suggest tools or steps to make it achievable."

Blueprint for SHIVA PART ONE
Think of "SHIVA PART ONE" as a super-smart trading assistant. It watches the market live, learns patterns, predicts moves, and tells you what to do—all in one app. Here’s a step-by-step plan in easy language:

Step 1: Collect Live Data
What: Get NSE option chain data (e.g., strike prices, OI) every 5 seconds.
How: Use Python with an API (like Zerodha Kite or Upstox) or scrape nseindia.com.
Extra: Fetch stock/index data (e.g., NIFTY, SENSEX prices) from the same source.
Goal: Save data in a file (e.g., CSV) to test it works.
Tools: Python, requests, pandas, schedule.
Step 2: Analyze Market Moves
What: Figure out why the market or indices move.
How: Check option chain:
PCR > 1 = bearish.
Rising Call OI = bullish.
Link stock/index moves to option activity (e.g., “Nifty up because Call OI jumped”).
Goal: Print simple reasons (e.g., “BANKNIFTY down due to Put selling”).
Tools: pandas, numpy.
Step 3: Predict 10 Minutes Ahead
What: Guess what the market or indices will do in 10 minutes.
How: Train a basic model (e.g., Decision Tree) with option data (PCR, OI) and stock/index prices every 5 seconds. Check predictions after 10 minutes.
Goal: Track accuracy (e.g., “70% right today”).
Tools: scikit-learn, joblib.
Step 4: Add Technical Magic
What: Use indicators like MACD, RSI, ATR for trading decisions.
How: Apply them to option prices and index/stock charts:
RSI < 30 = Buy signal.
ATR = Stop-loss distance.
Goal: Test one indicator first (e.g., EMA) on NIFTY options.
Tools: pandas-ta, matplotlib.
Step 5: Generate Trades
What: Suggest trades like “BUY 76500 CE at 85.”
How: Combine predictions and indicators:
Model says “up” + MACD crossover = Buy Call.
Set TP1 at +50%, SL at -50%.
Goal: Print trades to test (no real trades yet).
Tools: Python, custom rules.
Step 6: Predict Key Levels
What: Say where NIFTY or SENSEX might go.
How: Use OI peaks (e.g., highest Call OI = resistance).
Goal: Output “NIFTY may hit 76,800” based on data.
Tools: pandas.
Step 7: Stock/Index Section
What: Analyze NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX, or chosen stocks.
How: Add their price data to the model, correlate with option chain (e.g., “BANKNIFTY up due to Call buying at 50,000”).
Goal: Predict their direction (e.g., “SENSEX up 2% soon”).
Tools: pandas, API.
Step 8: FII/DII Insights
What: Show what big players think.
How: Scrape FII/DII data daily from NSE or Moneycontrol.
Goal: Display “FII bought 300 Cr = bullish” in the app.
Tools: BeautifulSoup, requests.
Step 9: Build the App
What: Make it a software with sections (Trades, Predictions, Stocks, FII/DII).
How: Use Streamlit for a web app showing live updates.
Goal: Start with console output, then add a basic interface.
Tools: Streamlit, tkinter.
Step 10: Save and Grow
What: Keep the model improving.
How: Save it daily with joblib, log accuracy.
Goal: After 15 days, check progress and tweak.
Tools: joblib, CSV.
Suggestions in Easy Language
Start Small: Don’t build everything at once:
Week 1: Get data (options + NIFTY).
Week 2: Analyze and predict.
Week 3: Add trades and indicators.
Test Slowly: 5 seconds is fast—try 1 minute first to avoid overload.
Free Tools: Use free APIs or historical data (e.g., Yahoo Finance) to practice.
Learn Basics: If new to coding, try “Python for Beginners” online (e.g., FreeCodeCamp).
Dream Big, Build Slow: The “God of Stock Market” is the goal—focus on one piece (e.g., NIFTY options) first.
